# OSM Editor Imagery Index

The goal of this project is to maintain a canonical representation of the imagery
overlays available to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) editors like
[iD](https://github.com/systemed/iD), [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/), and
[Potlatch 2](https://github.com/systemed/potlatch2).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for help on how to contribute.

## Using this index

If you are using iD, you are already using this index!

For JOSM you can add `http://osmlab.github.io/editor-imagery-index/imagery.xml` 
to the preference key `imagery.layers.sites` in advanced preferences. You probably
want to remove the `https://josm.openstreetmap.de/maps` entry or you'll get the 
same imagery listed twice.
